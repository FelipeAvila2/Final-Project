# Twitter Public Opinion Analysis

This project was developed as the final project on the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp.

The objective was to build a algorithm capable of analysing the public perception from Twitter tweets. For the analysis, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz and Mike Pence were the politicians used as dummy examples.

Inside of the 'maindevelop' notebook you can find:

Tweepy connection

Twitter cursor scrapping 

NLTK Text Cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization and stop-words removing

NLTK SentimentAnalyser

Matplotlib Data Visualition

Sci-kit Learn for features modeling
